<a href="https://qeep.vercel.app/" target="_blank" >QeepApp</a>  is a simple and intuitive note-taking app built with React that allows users to quickly jot down their thoughts and ideas. With QeepApp, users can easily create, save and delete notes, as well as organize them using labels. QeepApp is also **fully responsive** so you can access it from your **Desktop**, **Tablet**, or **mobile phone**.

## Features

-  **Create notes:** Quickly create new notes with a title and body text.
-  **Delete notes:** Delete notes that are no longer needed.
-  **Cross-device usage:** QeepApp's responsive design ensures that the app looks great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. Each with its local storage.
-  **Dynamic UI:** QeepApp's Dynamic UI feature includes a dynamic, beautiful and functional background image, along with a working clock that updates in real-time, giving a fresh experience each session.

## How to Set Up and Run Qeepp App Locally

To improve QeepApp, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies using `git clone https://github.com/HAYVENO/Qeepp-App.git` then `cd Qeepp-app` to open the directory, and `npm install` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start the app on your local server.

Here is the code snippet:

```bash
# Clone the Qeepp-App repository from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/HAYVENO/Qeepp-App.git

# Change the current directory to the newly cloned repository
$ cd Qeepp-app

# Install the required dependencies using npm package manager
$ npm install

# Start the development server for the application
$ npm start

```

You can create new notes, edit existing ones, and organize them using labels. When you're done using the app, your notes will be saved in the browser's Local Storage, so they'll be available the next time you open the app.
