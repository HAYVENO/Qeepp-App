QeepApp is a simple and intuitive note-taking app built with React that allows users to quickly jot down their thoughts and ideas. With QeepApp, users can easily create, edit, and delete notes, as well as organize them using labels.

## Features

-  **Create notes:** Quickly create new notes with a title and body text.
-  **Delete notes:** Delete notes that are no longer needed.
-  **Cross-device usage:** QeepApp's responsive design ensures that the app looks great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. Each with its local storage.

## Technologies Used

QeepApp was built using the following technologies:

-  **React:** The app was built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-  **React Hooks:** React Hooks were used to manage the state of the app and handle user interactions.
-  **Local Storage:** The app uses the browser's Local Storage API to persist notes across sessions. No servers, no privacy breach â€” your notes, your safe.

To use QeepApp, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies using `git clone https://github.com/HAYVENO/Qeepp-App.git` then `cd Qeepp-app` to open the directory, and `npm install` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start the app on your local server.
